# ESP8266 Configuring and Setup

### 6. Configure Wi-Fi and OTA
   After installation, ESPHome Web will prompt you to enter your Wi-Fi credentials:

* Wi-Fi SSID
* Wi-Fi Password

(Optional) OTA password â€” used for secure over-the-air updates later

Click Next or Install once details are entered.


### 7. Install Your Configuration
   Now youâ€™ll upload the custom SaltOwl ESPHome configuration (YAML).
   Remember to edit it and add your own Wifi Settings and IP Addresses in!

Click Install and wait for the flashing to complete.

> [!Note]
Once complete, the device will reboot and connect to your Wi-Fi network.


### 8. Add the Device to Home Assistant
   With your ESP device now on the network, go to your Home Assistant Dashboard.

* Navigate to Settings > Devices \& Services
* Under Discovered, you should see your new ESPHome device

Click Configure and follow the prompts


> [!Note]
If you set an OTA password earlier, you'll be prompted to enter it here.


### 9. Done! ðŸŽ‰
   Your ESP device is now fully integrated into Home Assistant. You can:

* Monitor sensor readings
* Control outputs (e.g., relays, LEDs)
* Update firmware via OTA directly from Home Assistant


## Tips \& Troubleshooting
If the device doesnâ€™t show up in Home Assistant, make sure itâ€™s powered on and connected to the same network.
Use the ESPHome Add-on in Home Assistant for easier long-term management of your devices.


> [!Important]
***Always keep a backup of your YAML configuration files.***
