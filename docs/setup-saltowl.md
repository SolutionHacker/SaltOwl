# ESP8266 Configuring and Setup

### 1. Configure Base ESP Settings
After installation with ESPHome Web, Salt Owl should be configured and displayed as below.   To setup / edit the code run by the ESP8266, click Edit

![SaltOwl Setup](../images/SA-Setup-1.png)

Here you will see SaltOwl's initial code.  This will be simular to below, but key sections will need adding or modifying as below

```yaml

sp8266:
  board: esp01_1m

# Enable logging
logger:

# Enable Home Assistant API
api:
  encryption:
    key: ""    # <- Add your Encryption Key here

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password
  manual_ip:                             # <- If you want a static IP, leave manual_ip 
   static_ip: 192.168.11.166             #    (and amend value pairs below to 'fit' your netowrk) 
   gateway: 192.168.11.1                 # Having a static IP is generally recommended!
   subnet: 255.255.255.0

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    password: ""                         # <- If you set a password during the setup process,
                                         # it will be listed here

  # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: "Salt-Owl Fallback Hotspot"    #  <- If the ESP Device cannot connecto to the configured Wifi, 
                                         #     you will be able to conenct to it via the Fallback Hotspot
    password: "zWMStNT3PBAV"             #  <- With this password

captive_portal:


```

With the base setup complete, add the the remainder of the script below the captive_portal: Line

You will find full code in [text](../salt-owl.yaml)

![SaltOwl Code ](../images/SA-Setup-2.png "SaltOwl Code")


Once Copied, Edited & Pasted, Click Install to compile and if succsesful, upload the code to the ESP

> [!Note]
Once complete, the device will reboot and connect to your Wi-Fi network, and the logs will show relevant output.

### 8. Add the Device to Home Assistant
   With your ESP device now on the network, go to your Home Assistant Dashboard.

* Navigate to Settings > Devices \& Services
* Under Discovered, you should see your new ESPHome device

Click Configure and follow the prompts


> [!Note]
If you set an OTA password earlier, you'll be prompted to enter it here.


### 9. Done! ðŸŽ‰
   Your ESP device is now fully integrated into Home Assistant. You can:

* Monitor sensor readings
* Control outputs (e.g., relays, LEDs)
* Update firmware via OTA directly from Home Assistant


## Tips \& Troubleshooting
If the device doesnâ€™t show up in Home Assistant, make sure itâ€™s powered on and connected to the same network.
Use the ESPHome Add-on in Home Assistant for easier long-term management of your devices.


> [!Important]
***Always keep a backup of your YAML configuration files.***
